# Ecommerce Analytics: from raw transactions to commercial decisions

Most dbt project repos stop at building a clean star schema. This one goes further and uses that model to answer three questions a commercial or product team would actually ask:

1. **Which categories make money** once cost of goods and returns are taken out, not just which ones sell?
2. **Do we keep the customers we win?** What share come back for a second order?
3. **Which acquisition channel** brings the most valuable, stickiest customers?

The data is modelled with **dbt Core** on **BigQuery** (star schema, tested, documented), then an analytics layer turns it into the findings and charts below.

> **Dataset:** [`thelook_ecommerce`](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce), a Google public BigQuery dataset simulating an online retailer. 181k order items across ~100k customers.

## Findings

> _Figures below are produced by [`notebooks/generate_insights.py`](notebooks/generate_insights.py), which reads the marts straight from BigQuery. Charts are regenerated on every run._
>
> ⚠️ _`thelook_ecommerce` is a **synthetic** dataset. Prices and costs are generated, not real market data. The figures below illustrate the **method** (how I would surface these signals on real data), not commercial reality._

### 1. Category profitability is not the same as category revenue

Ranking categories by **gross margin (£)** (revenue minus cost of goods) rather than revenue changes the picture entirely. The chart shows which categories clear a healthy margin and which barely break even. Return rate is tracked alongside as a second risk signal, though it is reported per category rather than deducted from the margin figure.

Note: bars are sorted by absolute gross margin in £ rather than margin percentage. A shorter bar can carry a higher percentage if that category has lower total sales volume.

![Category gross margin](images/category_margin.png)

- Highest margin category: **`Blazers & Jackets`** (`62%` margin)
- Lowest margin category: **`Clothing Sets`** (`38%` margin)
- Highest return rate: **`Clothing Sets`** (`15%` of items returned)

**So what:** a revenue view would push spend toward the top-selling categories. The margin and returns view flags where that revenue is actually profitable, and where returns are quietly eroding it.

### 2. Retention is the real story

Grouping customers by the month of their first order and measuring how many return gives the **repeat purchase rate**, the single clearest signal of whether the business is building a customer base or just renting one.

![Repeat purchase rate by cohort](images/retention_cohorts.png)

- Overall repeat purchase rate: **`33.5%`**

> _Caveat: "repeat" here means two or more orders ever, so the most recent cohorts have had less time to place a second order and will read lower for that reason alone. The dip toward recent months is partly an observation window effect, not pure retention decay. A fixed window (such as repeat within 90 days of first order) is the natural next iteration._

**So what:** acquisition is only half the picture. If repeat rate is low and flat across cohorts, the lever is not more new customers. It is getting existing customers to a second order.

### 3. Channels are not equal

Channels are easy to judge on signup volume. The more useful cut is **revenue per customer** and **repeat rate** by channel.

![Revenue per customer by channel](images/channel_value.png)

- Best channel by revenue per customer: **`Organic`** (£`93`, `25%` repeat)

**So what:** the channel that brings the most customers is not necessarily the one that brings the most value. This is where budget should follow.

## The data model

A standard three-layer dbt architecture (sources, staging views, marts tables) with an added analytics layer for the questions above.

```
bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce   (sources)
        │
        ▼
  staging/   stg_orders · stg_order_items · stg_products · stg_users   (views, clean + rename)
        │
        ▼
  marts/     fct_order_items · dim_orders · dim_products · dim_users    (tables, star schema)
        │
        ▼
  marts/analytics/   mart_category_performance · mart_customer_retention · mart_channel_performance
```

![Lineage graph](lineage.png)

| Layer | Models | Materialised as |
|---|---|---|
| Staging | 4 | Views: clean and rename, no business logic |
| Marts (dimensional) | 1 fact + 3 dims | Tables: the star schema |
| Marts (analytics) | 3 | Tables: the question-answering layer |

## Data quality

Testing goes beyond "keys are unique". The suite covers:

- **Referential integrity:** every `fct_order_items` row must resolve to a real order, user, and product (`relationships` tests)
- **Accepted values:** order `status` can only be one of the five known states
- **Range checks:** every rate (margin %, return rate, repeat rate) must fall within sensible bounds, so a bad join cannot silently produce a nonsensical chart ([`tests/assert_rates_within_bounds.sql`](tests/assert_rates_within_bounds.sql))
- **Uniqueness and not null** on every primary and foreign key

```
dbt test  →  all passing
```

<summary><strong>Run it yourself</strong></summary>

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12, dbt BigQuery adapter (`pip install dbt-bigquery`)
- A Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled, authenticated via:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform
```

### Build the model and run the tests
```bash
dbt run         # builds staging, marts, and the analytics layer
dbt test        # runs the full test suite
dbt docs generate && dbt docs serve   # browse the lineage graph
```

### Generate the findings and charts
```bash
cd notebooks
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_insights.py --project YOUR_GCP_PROJECT --dataset dbt_analytics
```

This writes the three charts into `images/` and prints the headline figures to paste into the Findings section above.

### Configure `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`
```yaml
my_analytics_project:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: bigquery
      method: oauth
      project: YOUR_GCP_PROJECT_ID
      dataset: dbt_analytics
      threads: 4
      location: US
```
